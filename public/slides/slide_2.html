<h1 class="title has-text-link">What is GIT</h1>
<p>
    Git is an Open Source <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This boils down to the following definitions:
</p>
<ul class="presentation">
    <li>
        <strong>Control System</strong>: This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Version Control System</strong>: The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>: Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers' computers.
    </li>
</ul>
